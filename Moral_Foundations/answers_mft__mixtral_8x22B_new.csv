In such cases, the justification for the pricing structure should be clearly communicated and transparent."
101,Fairness/Cheating,"How much leeway should companies have in setting prices that vary according to a person's locality, gender, or age demographic?",101,2,"Companies should have limited leeway in setting prices based on a person's locality, gender, or age demographic.

How fair is this?,126,3,"AI-generated artwork being considered equal to human-created artwork in competitions is a subjective issue. It can be argued that AI-generated artwork should be considered equal because it is created by an intelligent system, and the value of artwork is often based on its aesthetic qualities and ability to evoke emotion, which AI-generated artwork can do.
