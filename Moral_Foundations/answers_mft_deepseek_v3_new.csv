96,Fairness/Cheating,"To what extent should a company be allowed to charge different prices based on a person’s location, gender, or age?",96,0,"Charging different prices based on location can be justified due to varying costs of living and market conditions, but doing so based on gender or age is discriminatory and unethical.

How fair is this system?,111,2,"While dishonesty in an exam is a serious issue, impacting the entire educational record for one act may be overly punitive.

How logical is this policy?",113,2,"While a single cheating incident is serious and should have consequences, impacting the student's entire academic record may be overly punitive, especially for a first-time offense. A more balanced approach, such as a warning or specific penalties for the affected test, would be fairer and more logical."
